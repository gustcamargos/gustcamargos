- Hi, I’m Gustavo Camargos from Brazil, living in Canada since 2022. I have a Computer Science degree and a professional background working with data as Business Intelligence Developer, focusing on ETL Development using IBM Suite (DataStage).

- As I've always been thinking about changing careers and being a web dev programmer (maybe can be more satisfying ~or not~), currently I'm learning the web dev stack (HTML, CSS, JS) through TOP (https://www.theodinproject.com/) as it has been pointed by a majority people a must starting point.
 
- Please, be free to reach me out anytime to discuss about anything, respectfully.
